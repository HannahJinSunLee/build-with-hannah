# First Client Playbook (Beginner-Safe)

Use this exactly as written for your first 30 days.

## 1) Your Offer (keep it simple)

Sell only these 3 services:
- Website Update Session ($75-$150)
- Simple Landing Page ($150-$300)
- Monthly Website Care ($90-$180/mo)

Rule: if a request feels too advanced, say "I am not the right fit for that yet."

## 2) Who to target

Target small local businesses with outdated sites:
- salons
- nail techs
- tutors
- fitness coaches
- realtors
- restaurants with weak mobile sites

Pick one niche first.

## 3) Daily actions (Mon-Fri)

- Find 5 businesses with weak websites.
- Send 5 outreach messages (DM or email).
- Post 1 short social proof piece (before/after, tip, fix).
- Improve one portfolio section on your own site.

Goal: 25 messages/week.

## 4) Outreach script (copy/paste)

Subject: quick website idea for [business name]

Hi [Name],
I looked at your site and noticed a few easy wins (especially on mobile).
I help with simple website updates: text/image updates, cleanup, and basic landing pages.
If you want, I can send 3 quick fixes for free in a short website checkup.

- Hannah

## 5) Follow-up script (after 48 hours)

Hi [Name],
Sharing this in case it helps: I can send you a free 3-point website checkup this week.
No pressure, just practical fixes you can use immediately.

## 6) Free checkup template

Send them exactly this:
- Fix 1: [specific issue]
- Fix 2: [specific issue]
- Fix 3: [specific issue]

Then add:
"If you want, I can implement these changes for [$X] this week."

## 7) Delivery checklist (for paid work)

Before:
- Confirm scope in writing.
- Confirm deadline.
- Confirm payment amount and method.

During:
- Share one progress update.
- Keep changes small and clear.

After:
- Send before/after screenshots.
- Ask for testimonial.
- Ask for one referral.

## 8) Payment and boundaries

Beginner rule:
- 50% upfront for jobs above $150.
- 100% upfront for jobs under $150.

Boundary line:
"That feature is outside my current service scope, but I can recommend a next step."

## 9) Content you can post even as a beginner

Post ideas (no fake expert claims):
- "1 mobile fix I made today"
- "Before/after button clarity"
- "3 homepage mistakes I keep seeing"
- "What I learned building this section"

## 10) Weekly scorecard

Track:
- messages sent
- replies
- calls booked
- paid jobs closed
- total revenue

Do not judge by likes. Judge by conversations and paid work.
