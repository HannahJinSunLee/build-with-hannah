A personal rebuild in public.

This project documents my journey into frontend development while I learn, build, and refine real-world projects from scratch.

About This Project

Build With Hannah is where I practice:
	•	HTML
	•	CSS
	•	JavaScript
	•	Responsive layouts
	•	Debugging and iteration

Instead of waiting until I “feel ready,” I’m building as I learn.

Every update represents growth.

Goals
	•	Master core frontend fundamentals
	•	Build clean, intentional UI
	•	Strengthen problem-solving skills
	•	Prepare for a professional frontend role

Current Focus

Improving structure, understanding layout systems, and writing cleaner, more maintainable code.
